# NetJam

**Save. Share. Spark the Stream.**

![NetJam Logo Placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/150) ## Project Overview

Welcome to NetJam! This project is a web extension and companion web application designed to help you effortlessly save valuable internet resources and share them with a community of like-minded users. Imagine a dynamic, real-time feed where the best of the web is curated by its users. That's NetJam.

### What is NetJam?

NetJam is a tool that allows you to instantly save any webpage, article, video, or link you discover while Browse. It's more than just a bookmarking tool; it's a social discovery platform. When you save a resource publicly, it's automatically published into a community-driven thread, or "stream," where other users can see, appreciate, and engage with it.

### Core Features

NetJam is built around a few key functionalities to make saving and sharing seamless:

* [cite_start]**One-Click Save:** A simple click of the web extension icon or a keyboard shortcut is all it takes to save a resource instantly[cite: 9, 22].
* [cite_start]**Auto-Organized Threads:** Publicly saved resources are automatically published in a live, community feed where other users can discover them[cite: 10, 11].
* **Community Feed & Engagement:** Browse an ongoing stream of saved resources from the community. [cite_start]You can like, comment on, and discuss content with other users, turning saved links into dynamic conversations[cite: 11, 12].
* **User Profiles & Collections:** Each user gets a profile to showcase their saved resources. [cite_start]You can organize your content into curated collections or folders for easy access[cite: 13, 29].
* **Tagging & Search:** Add custom tags to your saved resources for easy categorization. [cite_start]This enables powerful search functionality to find exactly what you're looking for within your own collections or the community feed[cite: 14].
* **Privacy Controls:** You have full control over your saved resources. [cite_start]Choose to save them publicly for the community thread or keep them private for your eyes only[cite: 16].
* [cite_start]**Cross-Platform Sync:** Your saved resources are synced across all your devices, so you can access them anywhere[cite: 17].

### User Flow: How it Works

1.  **Installation:** Install the NetJam web extension from your browser's store. [cite_start]A quick onboarding tutorial will guide you through the features on your first use[cite: 19, 20].
2.  **Saving:** While you're Browse, click the extension icon. [cite_start]A small popup will appear, allowing you to add tags, a note, and choose your privacy setting (public or private)[cite: 23]. [cite_start]Once you confirm, the resource is saved to your profile and published to the community thread if it's public[cite: 24].
3.  **Browse & Interacting:** Open the NetJam web app or the extension popup to view the community feed. [cite_start]You can like and comment on resources, follow other users, or follow specific tags to customize your stream[cite: 26, 27].
4.  [cite_start]**Managing Resources:** In the web app, you can access your profile to organize your saved resources into collections, edit their tags and notes, and manage your privacy settings[cite: 28, 30].

### Technology Stack (Proposed)

To get this project off the ground, we can consider a tech stack that's robust, scalable, and ideal for a web extension and web app.

* **Frontend (Web Extension & Web App):** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React, Vue, or Svelte are great choices for a dynamic UI).
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express or a similar framework for the API.
* **Database:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store user data, resources, and interactions.
* **Deployment:** Vercel or Netlify for the frontend, and a service like Heroku or DigitalOcean for the backend.
